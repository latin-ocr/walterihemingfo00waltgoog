of a Synodical deprivation. Which plainly shew that, as
the Prince ¹was not, so neither was the Metropolitane, al·
lowed to deprive asuffragan Bilhop' alone without the sus· ·
frages of a Synod. This lhews what the Rule was, what· “

ever the Pradlice might have been of some paffionate Per·
sons, which are by no means to be allowed sor Procedente
for the satisladlion of Conscience. And the Rule seems to
have been the same in the earlyer times with the Western
as well as the Eastern Churches. Afterwards the Pope
assumed a peculiar Power over his collegues‚ as invested
withan Apostolical Power, which was conceived to raise
him to arank above other Bilhops‚ so as not to allow them
for his collegues. From that time sorwards even the Αᾶε
“ of Synods themselves, who were thought to have no pre·
tence toApostolical Power otherwise thanasth'ey received ,
itfrom him, were made precarious‚ and wholly dependent
on him, not concluded by the majority of suffrages. Then
he took upon him to musy, orabrogate‚ the Acts osCoun-
cilo, how numerous soever‚ as himself pleased. Thence ·
what he did, even in Councils, was more ascribed to him
than to the Councils themselves. Accordingly the lan·
guage os the Canon Law is, not Innocentius cnm Concilr'y
(imerali, even in the Canons made in Councils pretended
to be General‚ but, Innocentius incontrito General‘. Asis
the whole Legissntive Power had been derived from the
Pope, and the Council's part had been no other but pu- y
blickly to attest and promulge‚ what he was pleased to A&
before the Council, as the French Parliaments verisy the
Aes of the French King. This Prorogative, when chal-‘
lenged by the Pope‚ accordingly descended to those, who
need by his pretended Apostolical Authority. They al-
so challenged the sandion to themselves alone, even in
Caseswherein others consulted in common with them. So
Otto and Ottohone‚ by their Legatine Authority made
canons for our whole Ch. of England. And Lindwood’s
