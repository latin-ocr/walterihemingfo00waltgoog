To Mr.Dodwell.

DeareSir‚ '' Ε 0⁰⁶³·
· This comes express to bring you my hearty thanks, forltllasn'nm' ansr- μ.

your judicious ὃ( learned letter m reference to the Qfff mssfflffl· ,
ryesI was prevayled upon, to propose to you for your re· ··55 p.79‚
solution. The person concerned rs Bp Watson of St Da-

vrd s into whose hands Iput your letter forhis better sa· ,
tiafastion, which hee has fince restored to mee. Another
quaery more particular, viz. about the power of the Arch-
bifhop of Canterbury, and how farr rt may be extended &
exercised accordingto thel aner rrfEngland, in deprivinga “
suffragan Bifhop for a Simoniacall contrad't, reall Simony,

or any other crime, withouta Synod or Convocation, has
be'en sent to mee this day to transmit to you: which, up-

on aserious debate with my felfe, Ihave absolutely re-
frrfed, out osa just regard, that neither you nor Ι bee in-
volved in acause, which has made a great noise already,

and will make a greater, when it comes to bee heard in

Parliament. Ihave alleged, that you have not made ei-

ther the cidit or common lara osEngland your study: & that
,this is the pr'oper business of Advocates and Counsellors
' in both Facultyes‚ who know the measures osproceeding ·· J
in these and such like causes, and are pradised and conver-

sant in the judgments and definitive sentences of their re-
spective Courts: and therefore 1 could not honestly or
fairly trouble you any further, now they have drawn out

the generali case, in which the prastise of the Church and

the jurisdiction of Metropolitans in antient times accord-

ing to the Canens, on which it is founded, are concemed, ·-
intoa particular one, which 1 am sure does not belong to

you or mee to arbitrato. So that if such a quaety comesto Α
you by some other hand, you will not bee surprized,having

this notice ftom mee. But at the same time I do and must
conjure you to keep this secret, because it becomes mee to .
’ hee just to you, and yet civill to others. Ι am fully satis-

fyed, that, whether the crimes charged upon the poor Bi·
fhop, whomI heartily pity‚ bee justly and legally proved
·or
