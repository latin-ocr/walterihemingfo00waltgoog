Was surpriz’d to find (in your Appendix N. IX. ) the
story of the Pedlar of Swafham deliver'd with a serioue
Air, by so confiderabl‘e a person as St. William Du·
gdale, ond recorded by Sr. R. Twysden, asa fast, which,
upon due Examination, he was convinc’d to be true. Tho*

Ithau not deny the Poffibility of strange Discoveries by

loges to be no more than the Tradition of the place, Ihope-
you will not be displeas'd‚ that Ι send you some reasons
against it, founded ona View of that Church, for whi'ch·
