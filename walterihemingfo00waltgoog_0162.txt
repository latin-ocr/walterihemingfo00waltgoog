tion of Provincial Synods. For this seems to have been ·
· the Cale, stnce the time that the Arcbbilhopa of Canter-
bury were made Legati nati, on account of their place
·Thcir Legatine Power was a branchos the Papal Omni·-¹
potency, beyond the restraint of Conona, and above the

Power of their Adseffors. By this therefore the Archbi-
¹ fhops of that See got the whole Ecclefrastical Legissative
Power into their own hands, beyond the controll of the
Majority of their Brethren. And when thia was once grin·-
ed‚ it could not then be thought strange, if their coum
were allowed the Power of Judging their Fellow Bibopa,
and executing Canonical censurea on them. The same
Papal Omnipotency was then thought sufficient for both.
And thia Right of applying Laws to the Casea of particular ,
Persona, was really lesa than the Legissative Powet it sels,

¹ and therefdre a very natural consequent of the urguet!

‘ Right alre'ady gained. This seems to have been the Pte.

, rogative, of which the Archb. ofCanterb. wat possessed

before the Reformation. This was, for a while, conti·
nued to him by K. Henry the VIllth't. own Laws, whilest
ultimate Appeals were allowed to hirn. This was supposed
in the Canon Laut, fo favourable to the Papal Omnipo-
tency, and therefore to all the Power derived from it. And
that Canon Law is still owned aa obliging by our Statutc

, Law, as far aa it is not contrary to, or repealed by,it. And

the principal change out Statute Law has made, has been,
to free our Archbifhop from his dependence ou the Popc,
not to weaken the dependence of hia suffragans on hun, v
sofar as he is seconded by the Secular Powcr.

If therefore the Enquiry were, whether this ¹Power were
fit to be continued, Ifhould‚ for my part, rather wilh,

· that the Libertyes ofSuffragans were restored to their first

Original, at least aa they were by the Canons from the 4⁶¹·
Century and downwatds. Butl prefume your Enquiretis
aSubje&‚ who cando no more than wifh well to the re·
storing Prinutive Rights. Isso, all that will be fit to bede·-
bated hyltun, will be, whether this nght‚ such as ir iu,
owing its Original to Papal encroachments on the ancient

Canens, may be lawfully opposed by them, who havecno·
