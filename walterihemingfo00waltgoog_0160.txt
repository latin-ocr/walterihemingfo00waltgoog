For the Reverend und my worthy Friend Dr, Tho-

:2¹:2¹ss Dear Sir,

¹⁰12m63· My hands are so full with my Greek and Romane Cy·

μ’ 5⁰ cles, which have swelled beyond my expeffltions, thutI
durst not underteke the task proposed by you, were it not
for the condition you were pleased to allow of performing
it, of not writing largely. Ι hope, therefore, you will ex·
cnse and pardon, what Ῑ have not leisure to perform with
that accurmy, as had been requifite to answere the expe-
stations of so able aJudg‚ as well as so kind uFriend.

My opinion therefore is, that in the first times, 1 think
for the most part of the Ante-NicaeneCenturyes, euch Bi·
ihop was accounted supreme within his own distrio, and
that no Appeal lay from him, 1 do not say to Metropoli·

nods. 1 know no Bissrop deprived in those times barely
for male-administraturi, but onely for incapacitating
crimes, such as Idolatry, Haeresy and schism, which need·
ed no proper Authority to deprive him, but onely to with·
draw that obedience from him, of which his own Aes hrd
made him uneapable. St. Cyprian isfull to this purpose,
end denyes any Right even in himself, us afixt Metropo-
litane, to deprive any Biihop, no, not with the Carthagi·
nian synod, in whichhethen prefided. After the puceu?
tury‚1 confess the Canons do allow Appeals to higherSees.
But never, that Ι remember, did any of the Bilhopsofthose
higher sees attemt to judg, upon the Appeal, otherwise
than Synodically, either by a Synod affembled on the oc-
casron, or the wido* &Mn of the Bissrops then in Town,
if the Appen! was to (ΣΡ. The Cunons suppreffed by Dr.
Hody are very home in that partiemur. They allow no
