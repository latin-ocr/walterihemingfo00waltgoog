Ι told your Lordssrip in my last, the liiihop of Ely was
appointed by his Majesty to attend the D[uke] of M[on·¹
mouth] and to prepare him to dy the next day. The D.

· wrote to his Majeity, representing how ufefitll he might&
would be, if his Majesty would be pleafd to grant him hit¹
Life. Bnt if that might not be, he defired a longer time,
ὅ( to have another Divine to affist him, Dr Tenifon, or
